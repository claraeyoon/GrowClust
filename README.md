# GrowClust

This repository contains the Fortran90 version of GrowClust, a computer program for the relative relocation of earthquake hypocenters based on waveform cross-correlation data.

The SRC directory contains the source code and makefile to compile it, the EXAMPLE directory contains a dataset and run file to test things out, and this directory contains a detailed user guide in pdf format.

**Note:** The Fortran90 version of GrowClust is no longer fully maintained in favor of GrowClust3D.jl (https://github.com/dttrugman/GrowClust3D.jl), which has improved robustness and useful functionality. Please give that package a try if you are interested or having issues with this one.
